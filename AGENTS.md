# AGENTS.md

## Purpose
Quick guide for AI agents working in this repo.

## Primary reference
- claude.md (read first every session; it contains project rules and context)

## Expectations
- Follow claude.md: no phase markers, deprecation notes, or backward-compat code; use logger instead of console in production code.
- Read relevant docs in /docs before making changes; prefer doc-first and TDD workflow.
- Keep code timeless and clean; comments explain why, not when; avoid unnecessary abstraction.
