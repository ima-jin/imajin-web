2. **Content:** Professional photography in residential settings
3. **Design:** High-fidelity mockups with brand assets, colors, typography

### Development
Follow **IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md** phases:
- Phase 1: Foundation (Next.js, Docker, database)
- Phase 2.1: Product data management
- Phase 2.2: Product catalog pages
- Phase 2.3: Shopping cart (use these wireframes as spec)
- Phase 2.4: Checkout integration

## Annotations

Each wireframe includes yellow annotation boxes with:
- üìù Design rationale
- üí° Strategic notes
- üéØ Target customer considerations
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Important implementation notes

These annotations explain WHY certain design decisions were made and should inform development.

## Feedback & Iteration

These are low-fidelity wireframes (structure, not styling). Expect:
- Typography refinement
- Color palette application
- Real photography
- Micro-interactions
- Animation/transitions
- Mobile-specific layouts

But the core user flow and information architecture should remain consistent.
