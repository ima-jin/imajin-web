# Task Grooming: Quick Start Guide

**For:** Dr. Director and all development team members
**Purpose:** Fast reference for conducting task grooming sessions

---

## What is Grooming?

**Grooming** is a mandatory review process where all specialists (Doctors) review, provide input, and approve task documents before implementation begins.

**Goal:** Unanimous approval from all 5 Doctors before coding starts.

---

## The 3-Phase Workflow

### Phase 1: Draft (Dr. Director) - 1-2 hours

```bash
1. Copy template
2. Fill all sections
3. Enumerate ALL tests
4. Add grooming section (template includes it)
5. Mark status: "Ready for Grooming üü°"
```

### Phase 2: Grooming (All Doctors) - 24-48 hours

```bash
Dr. Director initiates ‚Üí All doctors review (parallel) ‚Üí
Address feedback ‚Üí Update doc ‚Üí Re-review ‚Üí Unanimous approval
```

### Phase 3: Authorization (Dr. Director) - Immediate

```bash
Verify all approvals ‚Üí Change status ‚Üí Authorize implementation
```

## For Doctors: Reviewing Task Documents

### Your Responsibilities

1. **Read entire task document** (not just your section)
2. **Fill out your review section** in Grooming Section
3. **Check all checklist items** relevant to your role
4. **Provide specific feedback** (not just "looks good")
5. **List concerns/questions** explicitly
6. **Mark approval status** (‚ùå Pending or ‚úÖ Approved)
7. **Add review date** when complete

### Review Timeline

- **Target:** 24 hours from grooming request
- **Acceptable:** 48 hours if complex
- **Unacceptable:** >48 hours (blocks entire team)

### When to Approve

‚úÖ **Approve when:**
- All your checklist items checked
- No concerns remaining
- Feedback addressed satisfactorily
- Ready for implementation

‚ùå **Don't approve when:**
- Checklist items unchecked
- Concerns unresolved
- Unclear requirements
- Significant risks unaddressed

### Providing Feedback

**Bad Feedback:**
```
Looks good to me.
```

**Good Feedback:**
```
**Feedback:**
Overall architecture is sound. Two suggestions:

1. Lines 150-175: Proposed polling fallback adds unnecessary
   complexity. Recommend WebSocket-only for MVP, add polling
   in Phase 2.6 if needed.

2. Lines 220-235: Connection pooling - suggest reusing existing
   Redis connections instead of creating new pool.

**Concerns/Questions:**
1. ‚úÖ RESOLVED: Polling fallback removed from scope
2. ‚úÖ RESOLVED: Using existing Redis pool
```

### Raising Concerns

**Format for concerns:**
```
**Concerns/Questions:**
1. ‚ùå UNRESOLVED: Missing error handling for API timeout (lines 300-320)
2. ‚ùå UNRESOLVED: Timeline seems optimistic - 20 hours for 75 tests?
3. ‚úÖ RESOLVED: Test data fixtures - Dr. Director added fixture planning
```

**Mark concerns as resolved when:**
- Dr. Director addresses the concern
- Task doc updated
- You're satisfied with the resolution

---

## When to Skip Grooming

**Full grooming NOT required for:**
- Small bugfixes (<50 LOC, single file, no schema changes)
- Documentation-only changes
- Test-only additions (no production code changes)
- Hotfixes (but get Dr. Testalot + Dr. Clean quick review)

**Still need for small changes:**
- Test case that reproduces bug (if bugfix)
- Dr. Testalot quick approval
- Dr. Clean quick review

---

## Red Flags

**Dr. Director should watch for:**
- ‚ùå Doctor hasn't reviewed in >48 hours (escalate)
- ‚ùå Doctor approved without checklist complete
- ‚ùå Concerns marked resolved but not actually addressed
- ‚ùå Significant scope changes without re-grooming

**Doctors should flag:**
- ‚ùå Vague test descriptions
- ‚ùå Missing dependencies
- ‚ùå Unrealistic timelines
- ‚ùå Security vulnerabilities
- ‚ùå Architectural debt
- ‚ùå Unclear requirements

## FAQ

**Q: Do all 5 doctors REALLY need to approve?**
A: Yes. Unanimous approval ensures no critical perspectives are missed.

**Q: What if a doctor is unavailable?**
A: Wait or find substitute doctor in same role. No exceptions to unanimous approval.

**Q: Can we start implementation while waiting for approvals?**
A: NO. Implementation cannot begin until all approvals received.

**Q: What if timeline is urgent?**
A: Communicate urgency upfront. Doctors prioritize urgent reviews. But still need unanimous approval - no shortcuts.

**Q: How long should doctor reviews take?**
A: Target 24 hours. Complex tasks may need 48 hours. >48 hours is blocking the team.

**Q: Can we do partial approvals?**
A: No. All 5 doctors must approve before implementation starts.
