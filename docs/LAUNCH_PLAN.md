- Announce Drop #1 date

**Week 1: Price Drop #1**
- Monday 9am PT: Announce Tier 1 pricing (basic details)
- Sales window: 7 days
- Early access queue gets 24-hour head start
- Tier 1 = One of [Basic, Premium, Founder] (order TBD)

**Week 2: Price Drop #2**
- Monday 9am PT: Announce Tier 2 pricing
- Sales window: 7 days
- Early access queue gets 24-hour head start
- Tier 2 = Next tier in sequence

**Week 3: Price Drop #3**
- Monday 9am PT: Announce Tier 3 pricing
- Sales window: 7 days
- Early access queue gets 24-hour head start
- Tier 3 = Final tier in sequence

**Week 4+: Open Sales**
- All tiers available at announced prices
- Sales remain open until stock depleted (Founder/Premium) or demand subsides (Basic)
- Early access queue members retain priority for future hardware drops

---

## Early Access Queue

### What Is It?

**Pay to join the queue = Pay to see prices 24 hours before public**

**Queue Fee:** $100 (refundable if you don't purchase any tier)

**What You Get:**
- 24-hour early access to ALL price announcements (Weeks 1-3)
- Priority queue position for future hardware releases
- Founder community Discord access
- Behind-the-scenes development updates
- Vote on community decisions (color options, feature priorities, etc.)

**What Happens to Your $100:**
- **If you purchase any tier:** $100 applied to your order total
- **If you don't purchase:** Full refund after Week 3 (no questions asked)
- **If you opt out early:** Full refund any time before final purchase

### How It Works

**Step 1: Join Queue (Any time before Week 1)**
- Pay $100 via Stripe (credit card or Solana Pay)
- Receive queue confirmation email
- Get Discord invite + community access

**Step 2: Receive Early Access (24 hours before each drop)**
- Monday 9am PT: Queue members see pricing
- 24-hour exclusive purchase window
- Tuesday 9am PT: Public announcement, general sales open

**Step 3: Decide Each Week**
- See pricing → Decide if you want to buy
- Buy now → $100 applied to order
- Pass → Wait for next week's drop
- Opt out → Full refund

**Step 4: Final Decision (End of Week 3)**
- All three tiers announced
- Choose tier (or none)
- If no purchase, full $100 refund processed automatically

---

## Why This Strategy Works

### For Customers

**✅ Control & Transparency**
- Know the schedule upfront (no surprise drops)
- Opt-out any time (no lock-in)
- See all options before deciding
- Clear refund policy

**✅ Fair Queue Priority**
- Pay for early access, not random lottery
- Early access queue ≠ commitment to buy
- Original queue members get first look at all drops

**✅ Time to Research**
- Week 1 drop → 6 days to research before Week 2 drop
- Compare tiers, read specs, ask questions
- Make informed decision

**✅ Price Discovery**
- See how others respond to pricing
- Community discussion during sales windows
- No FOMO pressure (all tiers available Week 4+)

### For Imajin

**✅ Market Validation**
- Week 1 response informs Week 2/3 pricing adjustments (if needed)
- Real demand signal (people voting with wallets)
- Can adjust stock allocation between tiers

**✅ Revenue Smoothing**
- Staggered sales reduce payment processing spikes
- Inventory planning has 4-week window
- Manufacturing can ramp based on demand

**✅ Community Building**
- Early access queue = engaged community
- Discord discussion drives organic marketing
- Queue members become evangelists

**✅ Reduces Guesswork**
- Don't need to guess final pricing upfront
- Can adjust based on BOM changes, manufacturing quotes
- Market feedback informs pricing (not guessing perceived value)

## Pricing Strategy

### How We Set Prices

**Component BOM (Bill of Materials):**

| Component | Basic | Premium | Founder |
|-----------|-------|---------|---------|
| ESP32-P4 | ❌ Basic MCU ($2) | ✅ ($5) | ✅ ($5) |
| Camera module | ❌ | ❌ (socket only) | ✅ ($8) |
| Sensor suite | ❌ | ✅ ($10) | ✅ ($10) |
| LEDs (512x WS2812B) | ✅ ($25) | ✅ ($25) | ✅ ($25) |
| PCB + enclosure | ✅ ($30) | ✅ ($35) | ✅ ($35) |
| Caps (square vs Fibonacci) | ✅ ($10) | ✅ ($15) | ✅ ($20 limited) |
| Power + misc | ✅ ($12) | ✅ ($12) | ✅ ($12) |
| **Component Total** | **~$79** | **~$102** | **~$115** |

**Plus:**
- Assembly labor (2-4 hours @ $40-60/hr depending on tier)
- Testing & calibration (0.5-2 hours @ $75/hr depending on tier)
- Packaging & shipping (~$30)
- Warranty reserves (2-year standard: $20, 10-year Founder: $80)

**Cost Per Unit (Estimated):**
- Basic: $200-250
- Premium: $350-400
- Founder: $475-550

**Pricing Formula:**
```
Final Price = (Component BOM + Labor + Shipping + Warranty Reserve) × Margin
```

**Target Margin:**

**Estimated Final Pricing:**
- Basic: $450-550
- Premium: $1,050-1,150
- Founder: $1,400-1,600

**Note:** Actual prices announced during weekly drops. These are planning estimates.

## Risk Mitigation

### Manufacturing Risks

**Component Shortages:**
- Pre-order ESP32-P4 chips (secure 6-month supply)
- Alternative MCU options identified (backup plan)
- LED strips: Multiple suppliers (not single-source)

**Quality Control:**
- 100% testing before shipment (no exceptions)
- Burn-in period (48 hours powered on, test patterns)
- Camera calibration (Founder units): automated + manual QC

**Delivery Delays:**
- Build buffer time into estimates (under-promise, over-deliver)
- Weekly updates if delays occur
- Refunds available if delays exceed 90 days beyond estimate

### Financial Risks

**Cash Flow:**
- $100 early access queue fees = working capital
- Staggered revenue (Weeks 1-4) smooths cash flow
- Manufacturing deposits paid from pre-orders (not out-of-pocket)

**Refund Reserves:**
- Assume 10-15% refund rate
- Hold 20% of revenue in reserve account (covers refunds + warranty)
- Refund processing: 5-7 business days

**Currency Risk:**
- Components priced in USD (most suppliers accept USD)
- International shipping: customer pays actual cost (no markup)

### Legal Risks

**Consumer Protection:**
- Refund policy exceeds FTC requirements (full refund any time pre-ship)
- Clear terms & conditions (reviewed by legal counsel)
- Regular customer communication (reduces complaint risk)

**Product Liability:**
- UL-listed power supplies (not generic Chinese adapters)
- Electrical safety testing (before first shipment)
- Product liability insurance ($1M coverage)

**IP Risk:**
- Open-source from Day 1 (no patent trolls can sue us)
- Trademarked brand name (protect against counterfeits)
- Prior art search completed (no infringement)

## Appendix: FAQ

### Customer FAQs

**Q: Can I upgrade from Basic to Premium later?**
A: Yes. We'll offer a controller swap service (TBD pricing, likely $400-500 for Premium upgrade). Your LEDs and enclosure remain the same.

**Q: What if imajin.os never launches?**
A: You're buying functional LED lighting first, OS capabilities second. Hardware works today. 10-year warranty covers hardware regardless of OS status. Specs are public (github.com/imajin-ai/mjn)—you can audit our progress.

**Q: Why doesn't Premium include a camera?**
A: Cost and need. Camera adds $8+ component cost and significant calibration labor. Most users don't need biometric verification. If you want camera, buy Founder Edition (included) or add camera module later (when available).

**Q: Can I sell my Founder Edition later?**
A: Yes. Transfer the Solana NFT to buyer—warranty follows NFT. Resale value unknown (depends on secondary market, protocol adoption).

**Q: What if I change my mind after ordering?**
A: Full refund any time before your unit ships. After shipment, no refunds (warranty covers defects).

**Q: How do I know you're not a scam?**
A: Fair question. Proof:
1. Working prototype exists (photos/videos available)
2. Open-source specs published (github.com/imajin-ai/mjn)
3. Legal entity (registered business, tax ID)
4. Payment via Stripe (PCI-compliant, buyer protection)
5. Weekly updates during production (transparency)

**Q: What countries do you ship to?**
A: USA, Canada, EU, UK, Australia, New Zealand initially. International shipping (customer pays actual cost). Other countries TBD (depends on demand, export restrictions).

### Business FAQs

**Q: Are you profitable?**
A: Not yet. This is a bootstrap launch. Target 60-70% margin to fund OS development and future hardware. Profit is 5-10% (rest goes to dev, ops, reserves).

**Q: Who's manufacturing?**
A: TBD (contract manufacturer selection in progress). Will announce during launch. Target: North American or EU manufacturer (not China, for now).

**Q: Open-source means anyone can copy you. Why?**
A: Philosophy + pragmatism. We want anyone to be able to manufacture (decentralize infrastructure). We make money on brand, design, warranty, first-mover advantage. Copycats won't have 10-year warranty or Founder Edition provenance.

**Q: What if ESP32-P4 is discontinued?**
A: Open hardware design means we can swap MCU (redesign PCB for alternative). Community can fork and maintain. This is why open-source matters.
